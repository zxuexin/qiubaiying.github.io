/When I was fifteen,I first readed the Carson Mcculealas's book <The heart is a lonely hunter>.It's so astonishing me.She like a
oriented writer compared to a American women.All through my younger age,this story inspired me a lot.Now after ten years ago,I
had a chance readed this book again through her english editon,I felt so pleasure to share my pespective and feeling about this
book./
